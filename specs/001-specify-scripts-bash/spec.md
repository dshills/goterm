# Feature Specification: Terminal Graphics Library

**Feature Branch**: `001-specify-scripts-bash`
**Created**: 2025-10-18
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Write a terminal graphics library that is cross platform compatible. It should high performance and have many of the same functionalities as https://github.com/gdamore/tcell. It should be fully compatible with https://github.com/dshills/gokeys since they will be used together for terminal games"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Basic Screen Rendering (Priority: P1)

A game developer wants to draw text and graphics to the terminal screen with full control over colors, positioning, and styling to create visual terminal applications.

**Why this priority**: Core foundation for any terminal application. Without basic rendering, no other features are useful. This is the minimum viable library.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating a simple program that draws colored text at specific coordinates and verifying the output appears correctly in different terminal emulators.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a terminal window is available, **When** the developer initializes the library and draws text at coordinates (10, 5) with a blue foreground, **Then** the text appears at the correct position with the specified color
2. **Given** the library is initialized, **When** the developer sets a cell with specific foreground and background colors, **Then** the cell displays with both colors applied correctly
3. **Given** multiple cells have been updated, **When** the developer calls a screen update, **Then** all changes are rendered to the terminal in a single refresh
4. **Given** Unicode characters are used, **When** rendering to the screen, **Then** all characters display correctly regardless of width (single or double-width)

### User Story 2 - Cross-Platform Terminal Support (Priority: P2)

A developer creating a terminal application needs it to work consistently across different operating systems (Linux, macOS, Windows) and terminal emulators without changing code.

**Why this priority**: Critical for library adoption. Developers need one codebase that works everywhere. This enables the library to be truly useful in production.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running the same application on Windows Command Prompt, PowerShell, macOS Terminal, Linux xterm, and other emulators, verifying identical behavior.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an application built with the library, **When** run on Windows, macOS, and Linux, **Then** the visual output is identical across all platforms
2. **Given** different terminal emulators (xterm, gnome-terminal, iTerm2, Windows Terminal), **When** the application runs, **Then** all features work correctly without emulator-specific code
3. **Given** a terminal window is resized, **When** the resize event occurs, **Then** the library detects the new dimensions and allows the application to redraw appropriately
4. **Given** varying terminal capabilities (color support levels), **When** the library initializes, **Then** it automatically adapts to use the best available color mode

### User Story 3 - High-Performance Rendering (Priority: P3)

A game developer creating fast-paced terminal games needs smooth, flicker-free rendering at high frame rates (targeting 30-60 fps) with minimal CPU usage.

**Why this priority**: Enables advanced use cases like games and real-time visualizations. Builds on basic rendering (P1) to make it production-ready for demanding applications.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating an animation that updates the entire screen 60 times per second and measuring CPU usage and visual smoothness.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an application rendering at 60 fps, **When** updating the full screen each frame, **Then** no visible flickering or tearing occurs
2. **Given** only a portion of the screen changes, **When** updating the display, **Then** only changed cells are redrawn (delta rendering)
3. **Given** a terminal game running, **When** monitoring CPU usage, **Then** rendering consumes less than 10% CPU on modern hardware
4. **Given** rapid screen updates, **When** rendering, **Then** frame times remain consistent without degradation over time

### User Story 4 - Color and Styling Support (Priority: P4)

A developer wants to create visually rich terminal interfaces using a full spectrum of colors and text styles (bold, underline, italic, etc.) to enhance user experience.

**Why this priority**: Enhances visual appeal and usability. Builds on basic rendering (P1) but isn't critical for MVP. Needed for professional-looking applications.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by rendering text with all color modes (16-color, 256-color, true color) and all style attributes, verifying correct display.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a terminal supporting true color (24-bit RGB), **When** setting colors using RGB values, **Then** colors display accurately as specified
2. **Given** a terminal with only 256-color support, **When** using RGB colors, **Then** the library automatically maps to the closest available color
3. **Given** text styling is applied (bold, italic, underline, strikethrough), **When** rendering, **Then** all styles display correctly when supported by the terminal
4. **Given** combining multiple styles, **When** rendering a cell, **Then** all applied styles work together correctly

---

### User Story 5 - Mouse and Keyboard Input Integration (Priority: P5)

A game developer using gokeys for keyboard input also needs mouse support for point-and-click interactions and hover effects in terminal games.

**Why this priority**: Completes the input story started by gokeys integration. Essential for interactive applications but builds on rendering foundation.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating a program that responds to mouse clicks and movements, verifying coordinates and button states are reported accurately.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** mouse support is enabled, **When** the user clicks at coordinates (20, 10), **Then** the application receives an event with accurate position and button information
2. **Given** the mouse moves across the screen, **When** mouse tracking is enabled, **Then** movement events are delivered with current coordinates
3. **Given** keyboard input is handled by gokeys, **When** mouse events occur, **Then** both input types work together without conflicts
4. **Given** different terminals with varying mouse protocol support, **When** initializing, **Then** the library selects the best available mouse protocol automatically

---

### User Story 6 - gokeys Compatibility (Priority: P6)

A game developer wants to use gokeys for advanced keyboard handling while using this library for graphics, requiring seamless integration between the two libraries.

**Why this priority**: Specific integration requirement. Important for the stated use case but dependent on core functionality being solid first.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating an application that uses gokeys for keyboard input and this library for rendering, verifying they work together without initialization conflicts or event interference.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** both libraries are initialized, **When** keyboard events occur, **Then** gokeys receives the events without interference from the graphics library
2. **Given** the graphics library is managing the screen, **When** gokeys processes input, **Then** screen state remains consistent
3. **Given** both libraries are running, **When** the terminal is resized, **Then** both libraries are aware of the new dimensions
4. **Given** terminal mode changes are needed, **When** initializing, **Then** both libraries coordinate terminal settings without conflicts

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the terminal window is resized to very small dimensions (e.g., 1x1)?
- How does the system handle terminals that don't support color?
- What happens when attempting to render outside terminal boundaries?
- How are zero-width Unicode characters handled?
- What happens when the terminal is suspended (Ctrl+Z) and resumed?
- How does the library behave when stdout is not a terminal (e.g., piped to a file)?
- What happens with extremely rapid resize events?
- How are surrogate pairs and complex Unicode sequences handled?
