# Tasks: Terminal Graphics Library

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-specify-scripts-bash/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are REQUIRED per constitution (TDD with 80% coverage minimum). Tests must be written BEFORE implementation.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Go library**: Files at repository root (e.g., `screen.go`, `cell.go`)
- **Platform-specific**: `platform/unix.go`, `platform/windows.go`
- **Tests**: `tests/unit/`, `tests/integration/`, `tests/benchmark/`
- **Examples**: `examples/hello/`, `examples/colors/`, `examples/game/`

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-8)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3 ‚Üí P4 ‚Üí P5 ‚Üí P6)
- **Polish (Phase 9)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1 - Basic Rendering)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories ‚úÖ **MVP**
- **User Story 2 (P2 - Cross-Platform)**: Can start after Foundational - Enhances US1 but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3 - Performance)**: Can start after Foundational - Optimizes US1 but independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P4 - Colors/Styling)**: Can start after Foundational - Enhances US1 but independently testable
- **User Story 5 (P5 - Mouse Input)**: Can start after Foundational - Independent input system
- **User Story 6 (P6 - gokeys Integration)**: Can start after Foundational - Coordination layer, integrates with US5

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation (TDD requirement from constitution)
- Tests can run in parallel if marked [P] (different files, no dependencies)
- Implementation tasks run after tests are written
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, multiple user stories can be worked on in parallel:
  - Developer A: User Story 1
  - Developer B: User Story 2
  - Developer C: User Story 4
- Tests within a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Polish tasks marked [P] can run in parallel

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Write unit tests for Screen buffer allocation in tests/unit/screen_test.go"
Task: "Write unit tests for SetCell/GetCell operations in tests/unit/screen_test.go"
Task: "Write unit tests for Clear() functionality in tests/unit/screen_test.go"
Task: "Write integration test for basic rendering in tests/integration/render_test.go"

# After tests are written and failing, implementation proceeds sequentially (tasks depend on each other)
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Basic Rendering)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Verify all tests pass, coverage ‚â•80%, benchmarks acceptable
6. You now have a working terminal graphics library! üéâ

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí **MVP Released!**
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Cross-platform support added
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Performance optimized
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Rich colors/styling added
6. Add User Story 5 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Mouse input added
7. Add User Story 6 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí gokeys integration complete
8. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Basic Rendering) - PRIORITY
   - Developer B: User Story 4 (Colors/Styling) - Can work in parallel
   - Developer C: User Story 2 (Cross-Platform) - Can work in parallel
3. After US1/US4/US2 complete:
   - Developer A: User Story 3 (Performance) - Optimizes US1
   - Developer B: User Story 5 (Mouse Input) - Independent
   - Developer C: User Story 6 (gokeys Integration) - Coordinates US5
4. Stories integrate and test together

## Notes

- **[P] tasks**: Different files, no dependencies, safe to run in parallel
- **[Story] label**: Maps task to specific user story for traceability
- **Tests first**: Per constitution TDD requirement, write and fail tests before implementing
- **80% coverage minimum**: Required by constitution quality gates
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Run `go test ./...` frequently to ensure tests pass
- Run `go test -bench ./...` to verify performance targets
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence

---
